# House-Price-Prediction
# Problem Statement
A house's value is more than location and square footage. Like the features that make up a person, an educated party would want to know all aspects that give a house its value. For example, you want to sell a house and you don’t know the price you may expect — it can’t be too low or too high. To find house prices you usually try to find similar properties in your neighborhood and based on the gathered data you will try to assess your house price.

# Objective
Build a model that will predict the house price when required features are passed to the model. So we will find out the significant features from the given features dataset that affect the house price the most and Build the best feasible model to predict the house price

## Data Description
We have more than 21k records having 26 features. These columns provide the below information

- cid: Notation for a house. Will not be of use, So we will drop this column
- day hours: Represents Date, when the house was sold
- price: It's our TARGET feature, that we have to predict based on other features
