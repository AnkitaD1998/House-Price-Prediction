# House-Price-Prediction
# Problem Statement
A house value is simply more than location and square footage. Like the features that make up a person, an educated party would want to know all aspects that give a house its value. For example, you want to sell a house and you don’t know the price which you may expect — it can’t be too low or too high. To find house price you usually try to find similar properties in your neighborhood and based on gathered data you will try to assess your house price.

# Objective
Build model which will predict the house price when required features passed to the model. So we will find out the significant features from the given features dataset which affects the house price the most and Build best feasible model to predict the house price
